SUPER VIRTUAL KEYBOARD

LATEST VERSION: Pre Alpha :(

SUMMARY:

Super Virtual Keyboard is a MIDI-generating plugin that allows you to explore different keyboard layouts with the intention of making microtonal scales, particularly
larger ones, easier to digest and compose with. This is actually a subproject of a more generalized, larger project to offer many different ways to analyze scales.

FEATURES:

 * This plugin does not yet offer retuning capabilities, so you will have to alter your synth's tuning. *

 - Select a scale from a large selection of mode presets then click the keys on the keyboard to play.

 - Hold "Shift" to hold down notes, "Alt" for "Mono Legato" mode, and "Space" to retrigger held notes.

 - Use "Up" & "Down" keys on held notes to transpose by one interval, or "Left" & "Right" keys to transpose by one modal step. 
   At this time, modal transposition is only possible if all held notes belong to the same mode (all white, all black, etc.)

TO DO:

 - Customize key sizes and positions
 - Add custom colors
 - Save custom layouts
 - Change keyboard orientation
 - Save as a Reaper MIDI Note Name file
 - Add note names
 - Shift keyboard by offset
 - Set transposition parameters
 - Graphics shading & other niceties
 - more...

BUGS:

 - Midi device doesn't get reconfigured when device settings change
 - Window resizing is bad funky
 - Top piano notes don't get drawn
 - Definitely some more...
