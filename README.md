Hey there, I will definitely be cleaning this up later.

This app has a long way to go but is bare bones functional.

Hold "Shift" to hold down notes, "Alt" for "Mono Legato" mode, and use "Up" & "Down" keys to transpose by one interval.

You can now transpose keys modally with "Left" & "Right" keys, if they all belong to the same order of mode. In other words if the held notes are all white, or all black, or all red, etc., they can go up or down one modal step.
